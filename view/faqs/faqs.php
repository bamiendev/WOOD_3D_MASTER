                            <p>Due to the distinct nature of wood, there are no exactly two identical trees ever.
                                Every wood grain from different types of tree is unique in their nature, therefore,
                                the difference in wood grain pattern is NOT considered a technical default and can’t be returned.</p>

                            <p>There will be minor differences between product images and the reality of the product's finished form (less than 10%) due to the individuality of the unique craftsmanship. If the final finish doesn't meet your wishes, Richfield Chairs would like to offer exchange vouchers for other products available at Richfield Chairs with the same value. But the delivery fee involved will be charged to buyer. No cash refund and we do not accept refunds in cash for products bought with vouchers.</p>

                            <p>Yes, we never store your full card details, only a token (that we use for future purchases) and enough information to display on the website so that you know which card it is, i.e. the last 4 digits of the card number. Also, we only allow the card to be used when the same delivery address has been used for the card before, which reduces the risk of someone accessing your Richfield Chairs account and ordering with your saved card.</p>
